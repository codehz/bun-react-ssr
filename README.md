# bun-react-ssr

WIP!

## Features

1. Use bun's native http server / FileSystemRouter / build system
2. React 18 Server Side Rendering
3. Client hydrate support
4. `getServerSideProps`! (note: I did some special processing so that it can be excluded when the client bundle is built, so you don't have to worry about mixing server and client logic.)

## TODO

* app dir mode?
* `"use server"`

## Usage

No docs yet, sorry.

See example folder.

Run example/build.ts to build
Run example/index.ts to start a server
